    A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of people. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.
<br><br>Throughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death (also known as The Plague), which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century.The term was not used yet but was for later pandemics including the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu). Current pandemics include COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV/AIDS.
<br><br>The number of lives lost in a pandemic depends on:<Br><br>
<ul><li>How many people are infected<br>
<li>How severe of an illness the virus causes (its virulence)<Br>
<li>	How vulnerable certain groups of people are<Br>
<li>	Prevention efforts and how effective they are</ul><br>
The WHO’s pandemic alert system ranges from Phase 1 (a low risk) to Phase 6 (a full pandemic):<br><br>
<ul><li>	Phase 1: A virus in animals has caused no known infections in humans.<br>
<li>	Phase 2: An animal virus has caused infection in humans.<br>
<li>Phase 3: There are scattered cases or small clusters of disease in humans. If the illness is spreading from human to human, it’s not broad enough to cause community-level outbreaks.<br>
<li>Phase 4: The disease is spreading from person to person with confirmed outbreaks at the community level.<br>
<li>Phase 5: The disease is spreading between humans in more than one country of one of the WHO regions.<br>
<li>Phase 6: At least one more country, in a different region from Phase 5, has community-level outbreaks.</ul><br>
